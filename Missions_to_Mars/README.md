# web-scraping-challenge

Included are the jupyter notebook file, the app.py file, index.html, and the table.html output from the app.py file
The app scrapes when you click 'What's the lastest news about Mars?' button and refreshes the data stored in a mongo database
I added another route to take the output of the scrape directly when you push 'Compare Earth and Mars', this shows the html table that is stored.
